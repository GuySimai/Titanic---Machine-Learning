## About the competition
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this project, I process the data of the survivors and create a hypothesis that will predict who survived and who did not by the given features.
## Summary
The first part of the project was very engaging. I learned how to manipulate the features by removing unnecessary ones and converting some of them into numerical values. I conducted in-depth research on the data and created a feature to enhance prediction accuracy. After evaluating both the GSD and MLP Classifier models, I chose the GSD model due to its lower error rate. I then trained the models on the dataset. It became evident that during training, the second model, which included the additional feature, was more accurate and had a lower cross-entropy (CE). Consequently, I submitted the second model, which achieved the best score.
